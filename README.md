# 💡 *Problem Statement*

With the increase in demand for Frames on platforms like Warpcaster etc, it was becoming difficult for people with no coding background to showcase their creativity using this technology

### 🥁🥁 *Drumroll, here...comes No Code Frames 🤝🤝*

No Code Frames is a platform where you can build frames without having any coding background. You can select an image or a video as the face of your frame, further adding upto 4 buttons and an input text if required.
If you already have a backend serving frames and only want a first frame for you, don't worry you can add your own custom POST Url as well.

# 🧠 *Knowledge Primer*

- **Pinata**

- **Frames.js**
  
- **Livepeer**

- **Base**

# 💪 *Challenges Faced (and WAGMI!)*

- *Video Frames*: Not much resources and availabilty on video frames really made us work pretty hard.

- *Custom POST URL Handling*: The way to handle multiple post urls in different frames was challenging for us.

- *User Experience*: Creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create the frames

# 💻 *Tech Stack*

- ExpressJS
- NextJS
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- Pinata
- Livepeer
- Base
- frames.js

# 📦 *How we utilized what*

- **Pinata** was used to store all the images into IPFS to have secure and fast paced retrieval for frames and provide user with great help, additionally an attempt to add frame analytics to each was also made.

- **Livepeer** was used to store the videos uploaded by users to showcase as the face of their frames. LDK was taken leverage of to handle all these situations.

- **frames.js** was used to create frames, get frames html, render frames and take care of all the POST requests made related to frames.

- **Base** is the only network which we only on our application and user can use base to cast their frames
